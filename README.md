This is just a simple, purposely flawed python login program.

This is for people who want to practice contributing to a github repository. I myself don't know how to fix this but I know the flaws. It is up to you to find them.

How to play:
- Find the flaws to this code
- Try fix those flaws
- If you can, optimise the code

This is just for a hobby and not of real importance. If you can, contribute. Thankyou for visiting this repository!
